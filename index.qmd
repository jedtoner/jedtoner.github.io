# About Me

My experience lies in:

- Bayesian hierarchical modeling  
- Causal inference  
- Machine learning  

I have worked on developing **complex market mix models** that incorporate various hierarchies and nonlinearities.  
I also have experience in **machine learning operations** (MLOps):  

- Productionizing models by building API servers  
- Maintaining CI/CD pipelines  
- Ensuring reliable and efficient deployment of models
