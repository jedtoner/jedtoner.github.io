Welcome to my personal website!
About Me
I am passionate about using data to find unique insights about the world. My experience lies in bayesian hierarchical modeling, causal inference, and machine learning. I have experience in developing complex market mix models that incorporate various hierarchies and nonlinearities. I also have experience in machine learning operations: from productionizing models by building API Server's, and servicing CI/CD pipelines to ensure that models are deployed and maintained in a reliable and efficient manner.
