## Experience

### Data Scientist ‚Äî Prophet  
*Jan 2024 ‚Äì Present*

**Data Science**  
- Designed and implemented a **commercial Marketing Mix Model** in Python (PyMC), applying Hierarchical Bayes with partial pooling, nonlinear regression, and advanced adstock/saturation dynamics. Achieved out-of-sample MAPE as low as **11%**.  
- Engineered a scalable **PCA framework in R** to condense a library of 80,000+ macroeconomic variables into actionable inputs.  
- Developed robust **time series forecasting pipelines** (ARIMA, VAR, LSTM/RNN) with synthetic data generation to ensure model continuity despite data delays.  

**Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**  
- Built and maintained **API servers**, fully containerized with Docker, and implemented CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions, reducing deployment time by **80%**.  
- Containerized and deployed multiple ML model interfaces to **Google Cloud Run** for scalable production.  
- Created interactive **model evaluation frameworks** (Python + HTML), streamlining model selection and benchmarking.  

**Data Engineering / Other**  
- Built and managed **end-to-end ELT pipelines** (Fivetran, SQL, Pandas, R tidyverse) to ingest and transform marketing data (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, Google Trends).  
- Designed and maintained **cloud-based architectures** (VMs, Cloud Run, GCS, Artifact Registry, BigQuery).  
- Managed **PostgreSQL and BigQuery databases**, ensuring data reliability and accessibility for analytics.

## Personal Projects

- **AFL Game Prediction Model**  
  Built a **hierarchical Bayesian model** to forecast AFL outcomes with **82% out-of-sample accuracy**. Designed an end-to-end ELT pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, and transforming match and player data for real-time updates.  

- **Property Price Predictor**  
  Developed **machine learning models (XGBoost, SVM)** to predict Sydney property prices. Pipeline included data collection, preprocessing, postcode enrichment via APIs, and suburb ranking analysis. Evaluated performance using RMSE and MAPE.
